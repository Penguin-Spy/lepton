# lepton
Create applications with the power of Lua and the familarity of HTML & CSS.

i have very little idea of what i'm doing here, so i might end up restarting this like 8 billion times lol

## roadmap:
- [x] Get functional lua environment
- [ ] create lua libs in c for `http`, `websocket`, `zlib`, etc.
- [ ] determine structure of lepton applications, create manager for installed luarocks
- [ ] create lua lib for creating windows w/ the system webview
- [ ] permissions, settings, appdata vs ROM, etc.
